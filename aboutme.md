<p>Graduated from UC Davis with a BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I currently work as a fermentation engineer.
In the past years I have found interest in how computers allow us to automate workflows and answer insightful questions. 
Some of my favorite topics are data science, machine learning and web app development. </p>
<p> I like to dig into data to extract patterns, useful statistics and provide insightful conclusions.
 I will be using this site to post topics or personal projects related to data science, bioinformatics, and web development. </p>
