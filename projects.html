            I was born and raised in Nicaragua and I was really interested in working on a project about the country. I found that the United Nations have a database with import/export commodity informations for most countries. 
            This was a great data set to learn how to use leaflet and how to work with json data.

            I created an user interface to randomly distribute your samples in microplates. Randomizing the samples ensures the distribution of your data is completely random and not an effect of plate bias of some type.
